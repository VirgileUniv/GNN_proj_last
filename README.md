# M2 project for GNN 

## Belief Propagation and its variants (loopy BP, uniformly reweighted BP (URW))

- The algorithm (and some useful function) are implemented in bp.py

- We test the methods (BP and loopy BP) with the exemple from [here](https://github.com/krashkov/Belief-Propagation/blob/master/4-ImplementationBP.ipynb)

- We control that there working well in the test_image.ipynb (using a grey scale test image)

- We measure the performance of our algorithm on (some) cow images of the [TU Darmstad dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/databases.html#TUD) in test_dataset.ipynb
(Download/extract the [dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/download/tud.tar.gz) and place the TUDarmstadt folder at the root of the project to run this file)
