# M2 project for GNN 

## Belief Propagation and its variants (loopy BP, uniformly reweighted BP (URW))

- The algorithm (and some useful function) are implemented in bp.py

- We control that there working well in the test_image.ipynb (using a grey scale test image)

- We measure the performance of our algorithm on (some) images of http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/download/tud.tar.gz 
(Download/extract it and place the TUDarmstadt folder at the root of the project)
